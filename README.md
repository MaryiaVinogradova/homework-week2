# 2: Professional Portfolio

## two options where set up for future professional portfolio
The first option (no numbers are included in name).
The second option (includes number 1 into name)

### The first option
 The firt option is more generic (linear) design. I've tried to upply all knowlege that I got studying past two weeks. The self-description and future work will be added. 
Have some issues to make the moving image move from bottom edge of the image to the top edge - so, you can see background color when make the screen narrow. 

 ### The second design
 The second option is more design oriented. Made by using complimentary colors. The future work and self-description will be added.
 I tryed to keep vertical orientation for the page. Not sure how to make baseline in the center of screen and apply max-width from that centerline. So, currentely the margin and padding right/left are applyed.
